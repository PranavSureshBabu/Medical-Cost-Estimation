**ðŸ©ºOverview:**

Predicting medical expenses has become increasingly critical in the healthcare and insurance industries. This project explores how demographic and lifestyle variables influence individual medical costs, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions around pricing and risk. Using a dataset of over 2,700 records, we develop a predictive regression model that estimates insurance charges based on attributes such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more.

By identifying patterns and quantifying their impact on charges, the model aids insurers in risk stratification and cost forecasting while providing interpretability into healthcare cost drivers.

**ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview**
The medical insurance dataset encompasses a variety of features known to affect healthcare expenditures. These include:

* Age

* Sex

* BMI (Body Mass Index)

* Number of Children

* Smoking Status

* Region

* Charges (Target variable)

This dataset contains approximately 2,700 rows and 7 columns. It serves as a foundation for building machine learning models capable of forecasting future expenses for new insurance applicants, thereby supporting data-driven pricing and policy design.

**ðŸŽ¯ Objectives**

* Explore and analyze key features influencing insurance charges

* Visualize correlations and distributions among variables

* Build and evaluate a regression model to predict medical expenses

* Interpret feature importance for actionable business insights
